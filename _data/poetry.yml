- title: "I Am the Quiet Witnessing"
  content: |
    I am not the name, not the story, not the thought.
    I am the space where all forms are caught.
    Not the wave, not the light, not the gleaming—
    I am the stillness behind all meaning.

    I am not the mass, not the field, not the fire.
    I am the pause beneath all desire.
    Not the form, nor the sound, nor the listening—
    I am the quiet witnessing.

    I am not the rise, not the fall, not the flame.
    I am the source before the name.
    Not the edge, not the echo, not the drifting—
    I am the quiet witnessing.

    I am not the path, nor the step, nor the goal.
    I am the depth inside the soul.
    Not the voice, not the self that keeps insisting—
    I am the quiet witnessing.
