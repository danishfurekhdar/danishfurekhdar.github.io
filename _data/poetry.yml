    Beyond the mountains, beyond the skies,  
    Where dreams weave tapestries of silent sighs,  
    The heart remembers, the soul still flies,  
    In endless echoes, love never dies.

- title: "Moonlit Reverie"
  content: |
    A silver thread of quiet light,  
    Woven through the fabric of the night,  
    Dreams unfurl on wings of flight,  
    Toward a dawn forever bright.
