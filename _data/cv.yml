  summary: >
    Theoretical AMO physicist with research expertise in strong-field ionization,
    focusing on nonlinear interference effects, nondipole dynamics, and electron
    momentum distributions in intense laser fields. Experienced in analytical and
    semi-classical methods including the strong-field approximation, saddle-point
    techniques, and partial-wave expansions, with recent work extending these
    approaches to few-cycle and twisted laser pulses.
