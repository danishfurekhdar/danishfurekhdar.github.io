profile: >
  Theoretical AMO physicist specializing in strong-field ionization,
  nonlinear interference effects, nondipole dynamics, and photoelectron
  momentum distributions in intense laser fields. Experienced in
  analytical and semi-classical approaches including the strong-field
  approximation, saddle-point methods, and partial-wave expansions,
  with recent work on few-cycle and twisted laser pulses.
