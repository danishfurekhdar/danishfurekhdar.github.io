## About

I am a theoretical physicist and doctoral researcher specializing in **strong-field and laser–matter interactions**, with a particular focus on **above-threshold ionization (ATI)** and **non-dipole effects** in intense laser fields. I completed my PhD at **Friedrich Schiller Universität Jena** and the **Helmholtz Institute**, where my research centered on understanding electron dynamics under high-intensity few-cycle laser pulses using analytical and semi-classical approaches.

My work primarily employs the **strong-field approximation (SFA)**, **Jacobi–Anger expansion**, and the **saddle-point method**, alongside numerical and computational techniques, to investigate photoelectron momentum distributions and nonlinear interference effects. I have contributed to several peer-reviewed publications in leading journals, including *Physical Review A* and *Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics*, exploring both dipole and non-dipole regimes of strong-field ionization.

Currently, my research interests extend to **strong-field QED** and **advanced laser–matter interaction theories**, with an emphasis on developing accurate theoretical models that bridge analytical insight and computational efficiency. 

More details about my academic output, publications, and presentations can be found on my website.
