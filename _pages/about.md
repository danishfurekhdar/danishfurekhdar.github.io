> “Behind every atom of this world hides an infinite Universe.” — Rumi

### 👋 Hello, I'm **Danish Furekh Dar**

I am a theoretical physicist who recently completed **PhD in Strong-Field Ionization and Quantum Dynamics** at the **Friedrich Schiller University Jena** and the **Helmholtz Institute Jena**, Germany.

My work lies at the intersection of **laser physics**, **quantum mechanics**, and **computational theory**, where I study how electrons behave when atoms are exposed to **ultra-intense and ultrashort laser pulses**.  

During my PhD, I investigated:

- **Above-threshold ionization (ATI)**  
- **Strong-field approximation (SFA)** in dipole and nondipole regimes  
- **Complex-time saddle-point methods**  
- **Jacobi–Anger expansion for few-cycle pulses**  
- **Twisted (vortex) light with orbital angular momentum (OAM)**  
- **Momentum shifts from magnetic-field (nondipole) corrections**  

My research aimed to build a deeper theoretical understanding of quantum pathways, sub-cycle electron dynamics, and the role of light’s structure — including phase, vorticity, and wavelength — in shaping photoelectron spectra.

### 🌄 **From Kashmir to Quantum Physics**

I was born and raised in the breathtaking valley of **Kashmir**, a place that naturally cultivates introspection and curiosity. Growing up between mountains, rivers, and poetry, I developed a fascination for both the **beauty of nature** and the **mystery of the universe**.

That curiosity eventually led me from Kashmir to Germany, where I immersed myself in the world of strong-field physics — studying how intense laser light can bend, distort, and even free electrons from atoms.


### 🌱 **Beyond Research**

While physics is a big part of my life, it’s not the only part.  
I am also:

- 🌿 A lifelong admirer of **Rumi’s poetry**, mysticism, and philosophy  
- 🔭 An **astronomy enthusiast**, especially drawn to the night sky and cosmic origins  
- 🎮 A casual **gamer**, unwinding with Honor of Kings, Black myth Wukong 
- ☕ Someone who loves long conversations over Kashmiri chai  
- ✈️ A traveler navigating cultures, identities, and new experiences  

I believe science is not just equations and simulations — it’s a way of seeing the world.
