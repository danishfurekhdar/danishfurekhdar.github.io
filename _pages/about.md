> "Behind every atom of this world hides an infinite Universe." – Rumi

### 👋 Hey there, I'm Danish Furekh Dar

I'm a physicist, dreamer, and passionate explorer of the unknown — currently pursuing a PhD in **strong-field ionization and quantum dynamics** at **Friedrich Schiller University Jena** and the **Helmholtz Institute** in Germany.

Born and raised in the heart of **Kashmir**, I grew up surrounded by nature's serenity and philosophical wonder. Those early experiences sparked my lifelong curiosity about the universe and our place within it. From the peaks of the Himalayas to the precision of quantum mechanics, I’ve always been drawn to beauty — whether in landscapes or equations.

After completing my M.Sc. in Physics from **Guru Nanak Dev University**, I set off on this exciting journey in Europe to understand how light and matter interact at extreme intensities. My research focuses on phenomena like **above-threshold ionization (ATI)**, where atoms are exposed to ultra-intense laser fields, using tools like the **strong-field approximation**, **saddle point methods**, and **twisted light beams**.

But I’m more than just a physicist:  
- 🌿 A lover of **Rumi’s poetry**, mysticism, and meaning  
- 🔭 An **astronomy enthusiast** with a fascination for deep space  
- 🎮 Casual **gamer** (yep, I play *Honor of Kings*)  
- 💭 Deep thinker who enjoys long conversations over chai  
- 🌍 A traveler, merging cultures and collecting stories  

This site is a blend of my **scientific work** and **personal reflections** — from research updates and academic guides to the occasional blog post about life as an expat, thoughts on philosophy, and moments of inspiration.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore and connect!
